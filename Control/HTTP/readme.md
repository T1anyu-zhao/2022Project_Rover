Right now, I am able to get all the information from the webpage.

To make the local server running, I require to open the server via node back-end.js in the ubuntu;
To use ipconfig to get the IP address of the local pc, so we could use the IP address to view the local server.

http://127.0.0.1:8000 is used to go to the sever without knowing the IP address used in the LAN;
